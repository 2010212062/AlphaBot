a. The producer can adjust the open-source agreement to be more strict or relaxed as deemed necessary.
b. Your contributed code may be used for commercial purposes, including but not limited to its cloud business operations.
c. Financial analysis algorithms and models developed as contributions may be incorporated into the core product.

3. Stock Trading and Financial Advisory:

a. AlphaBot is provided as a financial analysis tool only and does not constitute financial advice.

c. Commercial implementations offering paid financial advice based on AlphaBot must obtain a separate commercial license.

4. Knowledge Base and Vector Database:

a. The embedded knowledge base and vector database components are provided for internal use with AlphaBot only.
b. Extraction or repurposing of these components for use outside of AlphaBot requires a separate commercial license.
